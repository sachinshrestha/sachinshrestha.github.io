We all keep wondering what factors play a role in a person's annual income. We may think of hundreds of factors, but are there that many?

Here I use publicly available census data (source: UCI Machine Learning Laboratory) to find what factors actually determine whether someone earns more than 50K annually.

The census dataframe contains 13 variables that are shown in the table below. The variable 'fiftyKPlus' is the dependent variable, meaning that it is the variable to be predicted. Rest of the variables are independent variable that are used to predict the dependent variable.

<table border="1" style="background-color:#FFFFCC;border-collapse:collapse;border:1px;color:#000000;width:100%" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="3">

	</tr>
</table>

The variable to be predicted (also called *label* if you are familiar with **Azure ML**) has two values: *<=50K*  or  *>50K*. This is, therefore, a classification problem. To solve this problem, I will build the following models:

   1. A CART (classification and regression tree) model
   2. A CART model with cross-validation
   3. A CART model with optimal cp (complexity parameter) value
   4. A random forest model
   

After building the above models, I will compare the performance of each model and select the model that best predicts whether or not a person earns more than $50,000 a year.
