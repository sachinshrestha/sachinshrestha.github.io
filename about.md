<u>EMPLOYMENT</u>
PhD Research Data Analyst
Mar 2010 – Dec 2014
The University of Western Australia
Perth
<pre>
<ul>
<li>Undertook data analysis projects that involved the analysis of unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, cleaning and preparation of data, developing statistical and machine learning models, training, testing and validating the statistical/machine learning models.</li>
<li>Performed calculations for statistical data analysis using SAS, R and SQL – performed descriptive evaluation of data, correlations, inferential analyses, comparative tests, hypothesis tests, parametric and non-parametric analyses and created reports.</li>
<li>Developed supervised machine learning models, namely, decision tree and artificial neural network models in R to classify cancer patients into high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk patients.</li>
<li>Built machine learning models – CART model with cross validation and random forest model – to predict the response of cancer cells to drug treatment. Evaluated the performance of the models developed. Further developed and refined the model to predict patient-specific response to cancer therapy. Developed a recommendation system for targeted patient-specific treatment regime.</li>
<li>Built and used a predictive model to predict the growth of brain tumour and its effect on the surrounding brain tissue using biomedical and biomechanical data.</li>
<li>Produced and presented reports in meetings and conferences.</li>

<u>Projects undertaken in edX Courses</u>
<ul>
<li>Used an individual’s information to predict whether or not the person earns more than $50,000 per year. The source of the data was Census Data for Earnings, 2010. For the purpose of solving this problem, I built a logistic regression model, a CART model, a CART model with cross-validation, and a random forest model and compared their accuracies to choose the best model.</li>
<li>Developed a linear regression model and a regression tree model for predicting life-expectancy using publicly available census data and analysed predictions.</li>
<li>Built logistic regression models for predicting loan repayment, and for the prediction of business failure.</li>
<li>Carried out clustering analysis on stock returns, market segmentation for airlines, and for predicting medical costs.</li>
<li>Carried out text analytics on twitter data relevant to Apple iPhone 5C in order to assess consumer sentiment associated with the product.</li>
<li>Developed linear optimization models for revenue management, investment management under taxation and, outsourcing decision on textile production.</li>
<li>Developed integer optimization models for selecting profitable hotel sites, assigning sales regions for pharmaceutical company and, optimizing sales channels for organic farm products.</li>
